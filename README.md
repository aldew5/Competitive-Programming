# Competitve-Programming
Solutions and explanations to competitive programming problems in C++. Most of the solutions are my own, but some are the commented versions of another author's code. In these cases, credit to the original author is given in the header.

The algorithms and data structures folder contains individual templates for standard functions. These can simply be copied into your file during a contest. The templates contain standard implementations of frequently used functions.

Please use these solutions to help you understand problems. Do not copy them directly!
